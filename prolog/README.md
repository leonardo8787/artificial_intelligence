# Prolog

This part of repository is a study for prolog. Prolog is a computer language, it is developed by Jan Wielemaker. It is free software written in C language and can be run on different platforms. Its initial release was in 1987 and its first stable release was in 2021. In this software facts for any logical program can be written using conditional representation and after the compilation, the program can be tested for success or failure.

Prolog is considered as a declarative language rather than programming language as it is not used to solve computational problems. It is used to solve logical problems which use rules or facts. The full form of prolog is programming in logic. Prolog is used in much artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning problems. Prolog is used to write facts or rules for problems and then prologâ€™s run time system checks those facts and rules whenever that problem is asked and returns a true or false statement for success or failure of the problem.
