# intelligent agents

Intelligent agents are computational systems that have the ability to perceive their environment, process information, make decisions and act in the real world autonomously. These agents use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to improve their behavior and make more efficient and accurate decisions over time.

Intelligent agents are used in a wide variety of applications, from robots and autonomous drones to recommender systems and virtual assistants. Some examples of intelligent agents include:

A robot that can navigate an unknown environment and adapt to changes in the environment.
A virtual assistant that can answer questions and perform tasks on behalf of the user.
A recommendation system that can suggest products or services based on user preferences and purchase history.
Intelligent agents are characterized by their ability to learn and adapt to new and unknown situations, which makes them very useful in dynamic and changing environments. In addition, these agents can work together with other intelligent and human agents to achieve common goals and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tasks.
